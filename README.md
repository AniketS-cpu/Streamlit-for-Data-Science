### Getting Started with Streamlit for Data Science
Welcome to Getting Started with Streamlit for Data Science! I'm the author, [Tyler Richards](www.tylerjrichards.com), and I'm currently a Facebook employee who loved a Python library so much that I wrote a book about it.  
If you're coming here from the book, go ahead and take a peak inside each one of the sub-folders in this main repo. You can feel free to [clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository), and if anything doesn't work you can always [open an issue or pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request) or just find me on [Twitter](www.twitter.com/tylerjrichards) and DM me until I figure it out.  
If you're coming here from another place on the internet, feel free to use these respositories and examples however you would like! They are more useful in context, and so I would obviously recommend [giving the book a shot](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-Streamlit-Data-Science-ebook/dp/B095Z1R3BP). If you're a young data scientist who can't afford the book, please reach out to me and I'd be happy to provide a copy no questions asked.
