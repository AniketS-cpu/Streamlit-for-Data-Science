### Getting Started with Streamlit for Data Science
Welcome to Getting Started with Streamlit for Data Science! I'm the author, [Tyler Richards](www.tylerjrichards.com), and I'm currently a Facebook employee who loved a Python library so much that I wrote a book about it. If you're coming here from the book, go ahead and take a peak inside each one of the sub-folders in this main repo. You can feel free to [clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository), and if anything doesn't work you can always [open an issue or pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request) or just find me on [Twitter](www.twitter.com/tylerjrichards) and DM me until I figure it out.
